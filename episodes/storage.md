## Introduction

When academics first consider using web data as part of their research, they may not consider what they want the data for, or how they will store it. In our current data-rich era, it is all too easy to collect a lot of data without a specific plan for keeping it securely. We might end up with more information than we need or risk losing data due to a lack of planning.

### Data-rush!

Koen Leurs^[Leurs, Koen. ‘Feminist Data Studies: Using Digital Methods for Ethical, Reflexive and Situated Socio-Cultural Research’. Feminist Review 115, no. 1 (1 March 2017): 130–54. https://doi.org/10.1057/s41305-017-0043-1, 134.] identifies a 'data-rush mentality' which can be witnessed in the arts and humanities. Can you think of any research initiatives which rushed ahead to collect data without careful consideration?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

- It may be helpful to provide the learners with a specific example from your own research background. This could be drawn from your work, a colleague's work, or a publication, where you felt data could have been collected with more forethought. Offer this anecdote to help the learners reflect on the trend Leurs identifies.

For music researchers getting started with collecting web data about music, it is natural to be somewhat exploratory. It's also good to be excited about the research potential of web data! However, this section will suggest some ways to carefully consider data collection and data storage rather than simply rushing to get data.

## Data Minimisation

The idea of collecting only the data you need to complete your research is the main principle of **data minimisation**. This term has been used in both legal frameworks and research guidelines.

It is an important part of approaching a research project using web data about music more responsibly. To help *minimise* the data you have means asking questions like:

### - Do I need to collect this type of data?

If you are not planning to analyse date information as part of a research project, you do not strictly need to collect dates (e.g., the date a music video was uploaded).

If you are working on a deidentified corpus of text like user comments, you may not need to collect commenter usernames. Not collecting these would help you [protect users](protecting-users.md).

### - Should I delete or 'clean' some of my data?

A clean dataset is a beautiful thing! It may be helpful to consider what types of data you are going to use in your analysis. If you feel you have over-collected some information, for example a list of user IP addresses, it may be prudent to delete it. Third-party tools for collecting web data are likely to err on the side of gathering 'too much' information, some of which you may not need.

### - How long do I need to keep this data?

It may be tempting to hold on to data indefinitely. It is simple to leave data you have collected sitting on a hard drive or in cloud storage -- in some senses, the 'default' thing to do. You might also think that you will reuse this data in future. This is a valid consideration, given that social media data, in particular, is dynamic and prone to change. 

However, it is worthwhile considering how long you are keeping it. Arguably, data you have collected at one point in time may become irrelevant or outdated. There could also be legal ramifications for storing personal data for longer than you need. Many data management plans in universities will therefore prompt you to have a 'retention plan': considering *at the start of a project* how long you will keep the data you collect.

### Why data storage matters

As we have already addressed, thinking carefully about the use of data in music research is especially important because the kinds of information users share about music, and the kinds of questions researchers are interested in, are distinctly related to personal identity, culture, and ideology.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

It may aid memory to cite a couple of examples of music research using web data that learners are interested in, as discussed earlier in the lessons. Focus on the particularities of web data *about music* and briefly suggest why minimising the amount of data collected and the length of time it is stored may be worthwhile considerations.

## Data Speculation

![Researchers should strive to approach data collection and storage carefully!](https://y.yarn.co/2ecd5e54-c053-4abb-91bf-80c0ae0c6eee_text.gif){alt='Will Riker of Star Trek: The Next Generation saying "We need more than speculation, Mr. Data."'}

The idea of collecting a mass of data indiscriminately -- either more than you need, or storing it for longer than you need -- reflects the 'data-rush' mentality. Furthermore, as an overall approach to research, it is not investigative but *speculative*. The term **data speculation** has been critiqued as a process of 'amassing data so as to produce patterns, as opposed to having an idea for which one needs to collect supporting data'.^[Raley, Rita. ‘Dataveillance and Countervailance’. In ‘Raw Data’ Is an Oxymoron, edited by Lisa Gitelman, 121–45. The MIT Press, 2013. https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/9302.003.0009, 123.]

Collecting data then looking for trends is a valid research method. There is **nothing inherently wrong with more exploratory approaches to research**. However, it is likely to increase risks to [users](protecting-users.md) and [researchers](protecting-you.md). 

Consider that you may be holding on to data that a user has since deleted from the web. Holding on to social media data indefinitely is particularly problematic when one considers the rights of users to delete their posts and accounts. In law, this is called the **right to be forgotten**. Datasets collected at a specific point in time will inevitably include posts that users later choose to make private or altogether delete from live platforms, which researchers have ‘little right to maintain – and, in particular, to share’.^[Stockmann, Daniela, and Rebekah Tromble. Lost Umbrellas: Bias and the Right to Be Forgotten in Social Media Research. Edited by Michael Zimmer and Katharina Kinder-Kurlanda. Internet Research Ethics for the Social Age. New York: Peter Lang, 2017. https://doi.org/10.3726/b11077, 89.]

## Exercise: Music Research Using Web Data

Write one possible benefit and one potential drawback of using web data in music research.

::: solution 

Some potential benefits: 
* Access to a wide range of people's responses to music
* Quickly gain research data
* Minimal cost to data collection
* Increase statistical power of findings
* May discover patterns in big data that could not be seen otherwise

Some potential drawbacks:
* Not representative dataset
* May not be aware who exactly we are studying
* Ethical issues around informed consent
* Risk of losing context for data
* May be difficult to interpret large data sets

## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- The principle of data minimisation encourages you to collect and store *less* data
- The dynamic nature of internet data suggests it might be better to collect and store *more* data
- Designing research projects should involve careful consideration of what kind of data to collect, how much data to collect, how to store it, and how long to store it
- FAIR principles of data management are embedded in university research contexts and should also be considered
